Interview tasks - C#


Task 1 – C#.

    • Develop a Console Application using CSharp that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored. For example, a function called IsPalindrome("Rotator") should return “true” as character case should be ignored, resulting in "rotator", which is a palindrome since it reads the same backward and forward.

    • Create a new project in the same solution and develop another application in CSharp to check if a given word is a palindrome, but consider the character case and blank spaces. For example, a function called IsPalindrome("race car") should return “true” while IsPalindrome("Race car") will result in “false” considering the capital character.

    • Develop a Console Application that reads the file “Input.txt”. Create a class called “MovieStar” and assign the properties from the file to instances of this class. Loop through each object of “MovieStar” and display the properties to the console. Calculate the age of each actor as shown in the example picture bellow. Use “Newtonsoft.Json” framework.
